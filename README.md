# The Roam CSS System

## What is it?
The Roam CSS System is a modular, block-based approach for changing the look and feel of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com). It has been thoughtfully engineered to allow easy customization by the non-tech-affine end user and offers different minimal, beautiful designed elegant themes.

Thanks a lot for your support!

## How does this work?
- Create or modify your 'roam/css' page.
- Add a new code block **at the top** and set the language to 'CSS'.
- For the iA Quattro theme, add the following line to it:

```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/quattro.css');```
- If you want the lesswrong theme, add the following line to it:

```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/lesswrong.css');```

## Force light or dark mode
- If you want to force the bright or dark mode independent of the system settings use:

  ```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/quattro_dark.css');```   
  
  ```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/lesswrong_dark.css');```
  
  or 
  
  ```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/quattro_light.css');```
  
  ```@import url('https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/themes/lesswrong_light.css');```
